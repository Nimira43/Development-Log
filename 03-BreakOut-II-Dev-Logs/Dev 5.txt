1) Improved collision detection
2} Removed debugging code...

Debugger for brick / ball collision 
    
    ballX = mouseX;
    ballY = mouseY;
    ballSpeedX = 4;
    ballSpeedY = -4;

Debugger for brick co-ordinates and number of brick
    
    colorText("COLUMN = " + mouseBrickCol + ", ROW = " + mouseBrickRow + ", BRICK = " + brickIndexUnderMouse, mouseX, mouseY, 'darkblue');  

3) Game-testing for remaining bugs - ball gets stuck along vertical borders
